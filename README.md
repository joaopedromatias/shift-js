# JavaScript Shift Method

The goal is to replicate JavaScript's shift() functionality

# How will it work?

1. The shift() method must receive a list
2. The value of the first index in the list must be removed
3. The method must return the extracted value

# Example

```javascript
function shift(list) {
    // code
}

let myList = ['dog'. 'banana', 'orange']
const shiftList = shift(myList)

console.log(shiftList)
// return 'dog'

console.log(myList)
// return ['banana', 'orange']
```

# Testing

Create a test to validate the behavior is as expected, you can even start by testing to train [TDD](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/what-is-test-driven-development).
